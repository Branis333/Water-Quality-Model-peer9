# Water Potability Classification
This project demonstrates how to build and train a custom Keras sequential model within a Scikit-learn pipeline to classify water samples based on their suitability for human consumption (potability).

# Project Goal
The primary goal is to create and evaluate a custom deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras, wrapped in Scikeras, to predict water potability based on various quality parameters. The process includes data loading, preprocessing using a Scikit-learn pipeline, defining a custom Keras model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Water Quality and Potability dataset available on Kaggle.

    Description: This dataset contains various water quality parameters (pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity) and a target variable Potability (0 for not potable, 1 for potable). The dataset includes missing values that are handled during preprocessing.
