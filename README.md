# # Water Potability Classification 💦

This project demonstrates how to build and train a custom Keras sequential model within a Scikit-learn and TensorFlow pipeline to classify water samples based on their suitability for human consumption (portability).

## FEATURES 🧐
This dataset is found at the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/water-quality-and-potability?select=water_potability.csv

It has 10 features, with Potability being the target using Binary Classification. 
The rest being pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity

## # Project Goal 💡


The primary goal is to create and evaluate a custom deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras, to predict water potability based on various quality parameters. The process includes data loading, preprocessing using a Scikit-learn pipeline, defining a custom Keras model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
Different methods, optimisers, regularizers, and techniques were used in the model's training in other notebooks. Choose yours carefully
